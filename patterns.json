Both instances share the same structural error: assuming third-party service behavior that should be checked against docs or real data."

The recommended approach got ~250 words. No tradeoff matrix or 'what each approach optimizes for' analysis. CLAUDE.md mandates: 'Never commit to the first viable approach. Always explore at least two, preferably three. Present tradeoffs.' Conclusion was likely correct but process was non-compliant."
